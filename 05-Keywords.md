## JavaScript Keywords
JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial:

> **JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.**
