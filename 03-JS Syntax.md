## JavaScript Syntax

JavaScript `syntax` is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed.

## JavaScript Programs

A **computer program** is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by the computer.

In a programming language, these program instructions are called **statements**.

JavaScript is a programming language.

JavaScript statements are separated by **semicolons**:

### Example

```
var x, y, z;
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
```
## JavaScript Statements

JavaScript statements are composed of:

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

## JavaScript Values

The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: Fixed values and variable values.

Fixed values are called literals. Variable values are called variables.

## JavaScript Literals
The most important rules for writing fixed values are:

Numbers are written with or without decimals:
```
10.5
1000
0.562
3.1415
-56
```

Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:
```
"John Doe"
'Jane Doe'
```
