## Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, programming language mostly well-known as the scripting language for Web pages. JavaScript is available in all modern web browsers.

#### Some common uses of JavaScript
1. Creating dynamic web pages in the client side
2. In building server side applications e.g Using NodeJS (https://nodejs.org)
3.  Building Desktop Applications e.g Atom Editor, Slack App (http://electron.atom.io)
4.  Building mobile applications, both hybrid and native (https://facebook.github.io/react-native) , (http://ionic.io)
5. Building Commandline (cli) applications (https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli)
6. Hardware devices programming e.g routers, iot devices, TV apps e.t.c

>**CLI:** stands for Command Line Interface e.g Terminal in Linux and Mac systems, Git bash, Windows Command Prompt

#### What can JavaScript do for us?
* JavaScript can change HTML Content
* JavaScript can change HTML Attributes
* JavaScript can change HTML Styles (CSS)
* JavaScript can hide HTML Elements
* JavaScript can show HTML Elements
* JavaScript can communicate with external services

#### How does JavaScript compare to other programming languages
* Unlike most other high level programming languages which are `Compiled` to machine or byte code, JavaScript is `Interpreted` directly from the source code and executed by the JavaScript Engine.
* CoffeeScript and TypeScript compile to JavaScript.
* JavaScript is originally written to support HTML pages in the browser - This means JavaScript is already aware of browser environment and will easily process HTML pages and utilize web services offered by the browser without the need for extra configuration.

### Debunking JavaScript Myths
Please note the following myths and common assumptions
* JavaScript is the same as Java - this is false. Java is another programming language and syntax for both languages is different and not compatible.
* JQuery is JavaScript - not a full argument, JQuery is a JavaScript library, that means Jquery is not a programming language but rather a set of functions/methods that are written in the JavaScript language.
* JavaScript is only in the frontend - that's false, in todays world JavaScript can run almost in all types of computer systems from watches, phones, server side e.t.c NodeJS is a JavaScript based web server that allows us to write complete backends with only JavaScript.
